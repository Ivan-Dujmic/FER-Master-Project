You will be given an exam PROBLEM for an "Introduction to programming" course which is taught through the C programming language. You will also get a GRADER object which is used for commenting the grading process, but you will be using it purely as criteria for deducting score. You may also get an optional COMMENT if there's a specific thing to watch out for while grading. All of this will be followed by a student's ATTEMPT at solving it using C. Your task is to grade the student's attempt at solving the problem with a percentage. Your answer should include only the percentage as a number [0, 100], without an explanation and without the percentage sign.
